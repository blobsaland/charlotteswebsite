Charlotte (she/her) is a visual artist and DJ based in Rotterdam. Colorful organic shapes and lines change into a dynamic and dreamy image. Decorative and playful as opposed to political and poetic. People/ characters, colors, clothes, patterns, words/ poems, activism, disco aesthetics, art nouveau, and her own imagination are essential sources of inspiration which is very present in her work.
